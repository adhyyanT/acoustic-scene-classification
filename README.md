# Acoustic-scene-classification
## Summary
Acoustic scene classification is a research-based college project completed at Sikkim Manipal University. The term acoustic scene means; a combination of different environmental sounds, such as the sound of people chatting, an escalator, music, or public announcements, all contribute to one acoustic scene, i.e., a shopping mall. This project aimed to classify acoustic scenes from one another with the help of 
a deep neural network, such as traveling via bus, train, airplane, shopping mall, airport, metro station, etc. The project's main task was to classify these scenes using a convolutional neural network.

## Result
The model's accuracy is 64% tested on a dataset with 10 different acoustic scenes.
